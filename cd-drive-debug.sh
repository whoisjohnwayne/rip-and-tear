echo "  - Make sure to use --privileged flag"
echo "  - Mount /dev:/dev or specific devices like /dev/sr0:/dev/sr0"
echo "  - Check that CD device exists on host: ls -la /dev/sr*"
echo "  - Verify container has access: docker exec <container> ls -la /dev/sr*"
echo

echo "If running on macOS:"
echo "  - CD drives typically appear as /dev/disk* rather than /dev/sr*"
echo "  - Use 'diskutil list' to find CD drive"
